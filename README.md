# Physics Helper

Physics Helper (C++ Project) is a modular console-based application that allows users to calculate commonly used physics formulas in Mechanics, Kinematics, and Gravitation. The project is designed with clean and readable C++ code, making it easy to understand, use, and extend.

The program uses a menu-driven interface where users can select a physics topic, choose a formula, and provide input values dynamically. Based on the user input, the program computes and displays accurate results instantly. The internal structure follows a modular design, with separate source and header files for each physics domain, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

Physics Helper is open for everyone—students, beginners, and educators can use it to learn physics concepts through programming. Anyone can clone the repository, compile the source code using a C++ compiler (such as `g++`), and run the program locally on their system.

To run the program, compile all source files using:
`g++ src/*.cpp -Iinclude -o PhysicsHelper`

Then execute the generated file to start the menu-based Physics Helper application.
