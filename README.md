# PhysicsHelper
Physics Helper is a modular C++ program that allows users to perform calculations for common physics formulas in Mechanics, Kinematics, and Gravitation. With a menu-driven interface, users can dynamically input values to calculate formulas such as Force, Work, Power, Acceleration, Velocity, Distance, Time, Gravitational Force, and Weight.
