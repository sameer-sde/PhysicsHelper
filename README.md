# Physics Helper

**Physics Helper (C++ Project)** is a modular program that allows anyone to calculate popular physics formulas in **Mechanics, Kinematics, and Gravitation**. The program features:  

- **Dynamic input handling** – enter any values for variables.  
- **Menu-driven interface** – easily select topics and formulas.  
- **Modular functions** – organized and maintainable code for easy expansion.  

This project is **open for everyone**: students, educators, or anyone interested in physics and programming. You can **clone, compile, and run it locally** with a C++ compiler.
